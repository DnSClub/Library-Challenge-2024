# Kotlin Networking Library  

## IDE Recommendation

It is highly recommended to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html">IntelliJ IDEA</a> (community edition) for this library, as it makes it easy to configure the build files and run the code.

## Coroutines

Furthermore, if you plan to use coroutines please add the following line to your __build.gradle.kts__ file:  
`implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:[VERSION]")`  
This code has been tested with version `1.9.0-RC`.  
You can find more on this <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines#using-in-your-projects">here</a>.

Happy coding!
